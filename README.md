After adding Starter Content, you can open any map successfully which references assets from it.

(This project uses Unreal Engine version 4.15.)


Building (Old Guide - for the Urho3D Engine)
--------

This  project  depends  on  a   custom   version   of   Urho3D.  Clone  it  from
[https://github.com/TheComet93/Urho3D](https://github.com/TheComet93/Urho3D).   
You will need to checkout the ```iceweasel``` branch.

Install it to a well  known  place  on  your computer (e.g. ```/usr/urho3d``` or
perhaps  ```/home/username/urho3d```  or  ```C:\urho3d``` if you're on Windows).
You can set the install location with ```-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installation```.

You will also need to enable the iceweasel mods with ```-DURHO3D_ICEWEASELMODS=ON```

Here are the CMake build options for the settings described above:
```
git checkout iceweasel
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/urho3d \
      -DURHO3D_LIB_TYPE=SHARED \
      -DURHO3D_ICEWEASELMODS=ON \
      -DURHO3D_SAMPLES=OFF ..
```

Once you've  installed  Urho3D,  go  into the directory ```software/game```. You
will find a script named ```setup-urho3d.sh```. Execute it as:
```
./setup-urho3d.sh /usr/urho3d
```
This will create some symlinks so the Ice Weasel project can find Urho3D.

Next, create a build folder, cd into it and run cmake:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The binary is placed in the folder ```../bin```.
