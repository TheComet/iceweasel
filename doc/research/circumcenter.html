Let a, b, and c be the three given points.  
Use _0 and _1 as x and y coordinates.
The coordinates of the center p=(p_0,p_1) of the circle through them is:

	p_0 =
	( b_1 a_0^2 
	- c_1 a_0^2
	- b_1^2 a_1
	+ c_1^2 a_1
	+ b_0^2 c_1
	+ a_1^2 b_1
	+ c_0^2 a_1
	- c_1^2 b_1
	- c_0^2 b_1 
	- b_0^2 a_1
	+ b_1^2 c_1
	- a_1^2 c_1 )
	 / D
	
	p_1 =
	( a_0^2 c_0
	+ a_1^2 c_0
	+ b_0^2 a_0
	- b_0^2 c_0
	+ b_1^2 a_0
	- b_1^2 c_0
	- a_0^2 b_0
	- a_1^2 b_0
	- c_0^2 a_0
	+ c_0^2 b_0
	- c_1^2 a_0
	+ c_1^2 b_0) 
	 / D

where

D = 2( a_1 c_0 + b_1 a_0 - b_1 c_0 -a_1 b_0 -c_1 a_0 + c_1 b_0 ).

The radius of the circle is then:

r^2 = (a_0 - p_0)^2 + (a_1 - p_1)^2

Degeneracies occur when D=0.

More efficiently (20 multiply/divide operations versus 57) use

p_0 = (((a_0 - c_0) * (a_0 + c_0) + (a_1 - c_1) * (a_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (b_1 - c_1) 
    -  ((b_0 - c_0) * (b_0 + c_0) + (b_1 - c_1) * (b_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (a_1 - c_1))

p_1 = (((b_0 - c_0) * (b_0 + c_0) + (b_1 - c_1) * (b_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (a_0 - c_0)
    -  ((a_0 - c_0) * (a_0 + c_0) + (a_1 - c_1) * (a_1 + c_1)) / 2 * (b_0 - c_0))
    / D

where D = (a_0 - c_0) * (b_1 - c_1) - (b_0 - c_0) * (a_1 - c_1)

The _squared_ circumradius is then:

r^2 = (c_0 - p_0)^2 + (c_1 - p_1)^2

This approach uses Cramer's Rule to find the intersection of two
perpendicular bisectors of triangle edges

<b>To:</b>             "<a href="mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</a>" &lt;<a href="mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;

Circumscribing the triangle or tet or any simplex, given the vertex
coordinates, can easily be done algebraically with a little trick.  Expand

(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = R^2

to

x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 = R^2

Since this is non-linear in a, b, and R, it seems you can't easily use it to
find them.  But let

q = R^2 - a^2 - b^2                        [1]

and re-arrange to yield

(2x)a + (2y)b + q = x^2 + y^2              [2]

which is now linear in a, b, and q.  Apply at 3 points and solve by Cramer's
rule:

     |(x1^2 + y1^2) 2y1 1|
     |(x2^2 + y2^2) 2y2 1|   |(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y2 - y1)|
     |(x3^2 + y3^2) 2y3 1|   |(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y3 - y1)|
a = ---------------------- = ---------------------------------------
        | 2x1  2y1  1 |           2 * | (x2 - x1)  (y2 - y1) |
        | 2x2  2y2  1 |               | (x3 - x1)  (y3 - y1) |
        | 2x3  2y3  1 |

Similarly,

      |(x2 - x1) (x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2)|
      |(y2 - y1) (x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2)|
b = -----------------------------------------
           (same denominator)

This is equivalent to Watson's formula, which he derived geometrically.  (A
side note: Watson could have saved 3 more multiplications in his formula by
incorporating a factor of 2 into his denominator term D.)  It's then cheaper
to find R by the original equation than by applying Cramer's rule a 3rd time,
etc.

This can also be written down by comparing Eq. [2] with the 'three-point
form':

     | (x^2  + y^2)   x   y   1 |
     | (x1^2 + y1^2)  x1  y1  1 |  = 0
     | (x2^2 + y2^2)  x2  y2  1 |
     | (x3^2 + y3^2)  x3  y3  1 |

For the sphere about a tet (after factoring out the 2's),

     |(x1^2 + y1^2 + z1^2)  y1  z1  1 |
     |(x2^2 + y2^2 + z2^2)  y2  z2  1 | 
     |(x3^2 + y3^2 + z3^2)  y3  z3  1 |
     |(x4^2 + y4^2 + z4^2)  y4  z4  1 |
a = ------------------------------------
         2 *  | x1   y1   z1  1 |
              | x2   y2   z2  1 |
              | x3   y3   z3  1 |
              | x4   y4   z4  1 |

and so on.  (The determinants are easily reduced to 3X3 size.)

This is not original with me, and I'm uncertain as to the source.  I found
the result for triangles in a computer program that was written 15 years ago
(which I've been using ever since) but only recently did I figure out how the
formula is derived.

</pre><hr><pre>Yes, this linearization trick is pretty standard in computational geometry.
The specific variation you use, mapping a vector v onto (v,|v|^2),
turns circles or more generally spheres in d dimensions into planes
or more generally hyperplanes in d+1 dimensions. Your equation

     | (x^2  + y^2)   x   y   1 |
     | (x1^2 + y1^2)  x1  y1  1 |  = 0
     | (x2^2 + y2^2)  x2  y2  1 |
     | (x3^2 + y3^2)  x3  y3  1 |

is the standard equation for a plane through three points (xi,yi,xi^2+yi^2).

One reference for general ideas like this (i.e. of turning nonlinear
equations into higher-dimensional linear ones by adding extra variables
that are polynomials in the original equations)
is "A general approach to d-dimensional geometric queries",
A. C. Yao and F. F. Yao, 17th ACM Symp. Theory of Computing (1985) 163-168.
But probably the same idea was known long before then in
less algorithmic contexts.

I've added your message to my page (I assume this is ok; let me know if not).

Let a, b, c, d, and m be vectors in R^3.  Let ax, ay, and az be the components

and let a x b denote the cross product of a and b.  Then

and

Some notes on stability:

- Note that the expression for r is purely a function of differences between
  coordinates.  The advantage is that the relative error incurred in the
  computation of r is also a function of the _differences_ between the
  vertices, and is not influenced by the _absolute_ coordinates of the
  vertices.  In most applications, vertices are usually nearer to each other
  than to the origin, so this property is advantageous.  If someone gives you
  a formula that doesn't have this property, be wary.

  Similarly, the formula for m incurs roundoff error proportional to the
  differences between vertices, but does not incur roundoff error proportional
  to the absolute coordinates of the vertices until the final addition.

- These expressions are unstable in only one case:  if the denominator is
  close to zero.  This instability, which arises if the tetrahedron is nearly
  degenerate, is unavoidable.  Depending on your application, you may want
  to use exact arithmetic to compute the value of the determinant.
  Fortunately, this determinant is the basis of the well-studied 3D orientation
  test, and several fast algorithms for providing accurate approximations to
  the determinant are available.  Some resources are available from the
  "Numerical and algebraic computation" page of Nina Amenta's Directory of
  Computational Geometry Software:

  <a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/cglist/alg.html">http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/cglist/alg.html</a>

  If you're using floating-point inputs (as opposed to integers), one
  package that can estimate this determinant somewhat accurately is my own:

  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html</a>

- If you want to be even more aggressive about stability, you might reorder
  the vertices of the tetrahedron so that the vertex `a' (which is subtracted
  from the other vertices) is, roughly speaking, the vertex at the center of
  the minimum spanning tree of the tetrahedron's four vertices.  For more
  information about this idea, see Steven Fortune, "Numerical Stability of
  Algorithms for 2D Delaunay Triangulations," International Journal of
  Computational Geometry &amp; Applications 5(1-2):193-213, March-June 1995.

For completeness, here are stable expressions for the circumradius and
circumcenter of a triangle, in R^2 and in R^3.  Incidentally, the expressions
given here for R^2 are better behaved in terms of relative error than the
suggestions currently given in the Geometry Junkyard
(<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html</a>).

Triangle in R^2:

     |b-a| |c-a| |b-c|            &lt; Note: You only want to compute one sqrt, so
r = ------------------,             use sqrt{ |b-a|^2 |c-a|^2 |b-c|^2 }
      | bx-ax  by-ay |
    2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |

          | by-ay  |b-a|^2 |
          | cy-ay  |c-a|^2 |
mx = ax - ------------------,
            | bx-ax  by-ay |
          2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |

          | bx-ax  |b-a|^2 |
          | cx-ax  |c-a|^2 |
my = ay + ------------------.
            | bx-ax  by-ay |
          2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |

Triangle in R^3:

    |                                                           |
    | |c-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)]x(b-a) + |b-a|^2 (c-a)x[(b-a)x(c-a)] |
    |                                                           |
r = -------------------------------------------------------------,
                         2 | (b-a)x(c-a) |^2

        |c-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)]x(b-a) + |b-a|^2 (c-a)x[(b-a)x(c-a)]
m = a + ---------------------------------------------------------.
                           2 | (b-a)x(c-a) |^2

Finally, here's some C code that computes the vector m-a (whose norm is r) in
each of these three cases.  Notice the #ifdef statements, which allow you to
choose whether or not to use my aforementioned package to approximate the
determinant.  (No attempt is made here to reorder the vertices to improve
stability.)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am searching for a numerically stable algorithm to calculate the radius r
&gt; &gt; (and perhaps the center m) of the circumsphere of a tetrahedron in
&gt; &gt; three dimensions, given by the coordinates of the vertices a, b, c, d in R^3.
&gt; 
.....(part omitted).....
&gt; 
&gt; Some notes on stability:
&gt; 
&gt; - Note that the expression for r is purely a function of differences between
&gt;   coordinates.  The advantage is that the relative error incurred in the
&gt;   computation of r is also a function of the _differences_ between the
&gt;   vertices, and is not influenced by the _absolute_ coordinates of the
&gt;   vertices.  In most applications, vertices are usually nearer to each other
&gt;   than to the origin, so this property is advantageous.  If someone gives you
&gt;   a formula that doesn't have this property, be wary.

...(part omitted)..... 

&gt; For completeness, here are stable expressions for the circumradius and
&gt; circumcenter of a triangle, in R^2 and in R^3.  Incidentally, the expressions
&gt; given here for R^2 are better behaved in terms of relative error than the
&gt; suggestions currently given in the Geometry Junkyard
&gt; (<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html</a>).

In a private response to Herr Kerscher's question, I recommended that he
look at this page, particularly my contribution to it. Let me say that
Prof. Shewchuk's criticism regarding relative error is not only correct,
but also of some practical significance. The good behavior which he
refers to is obtained for 2-D triangles using the particular form
(attributed to Jim Ward) given by the most recent
comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ at
<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/graphics/algorithms-faq/faq.html">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/graphics/algorithms-faq/faq.html</a>
This form has the desired property of using only differences between
coordinates.
An added advantage when using integer arithmetic is that such forms
avoid overflows in many more practical cases (e.g., simplex far from
origin).

Thus, my formula given in the Geometry Junkyard:

     |(x1^2 + y1^2) 2y1 1|
     |(x2^2 + y2^2) 2y2 1|   |(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y2 - y1)|
     |(x3^2 + y3^2) 2y3 1|   |(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y3 - y1)|
a = ---------------------- = ---------------------------------------
        | 2x1  2y1  1 |           2 * | (x2 - x1)  (y2 - y1) |
        | 2x2  2y2  1 |               | (x3 - x1)  (y3 - y1) |
        | 2x3  2y3  1 |

needs to be taken another step to achieve the desired property.
The terms in the first column of the numerator should be re-written like
this:

(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) = (x2 - x1)(x2 + x1) + (y2 - y1)(y2 + y1)

(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) = (x3 - x1)(x3 + x1) + (y3 - y1)(y3 + y1)

The formulas for tets in 3-D in the Geometry Junkyard need similar
treatment.
